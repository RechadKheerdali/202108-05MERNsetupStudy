study sesh, includes authentication CSR and etc...

- The master branch is the basic MERN setup for most things. However there is lots to be done such as dotenv / error handling / etc. Plus possible updates might be required
- The other branches are me practicing other things such as '02codeNinjaJWT' is me doing authentication which was cool using JsonWebToken for jwt token in CSR format. Would need a clientside to complete the full stack
- Ideally you want to set up the in a proper MVC directory, look into your guide for that
